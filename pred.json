    "prediction": "Your home could become a buzzing hive of activity today as the moon meets up with mobilizing Mars in your domesticity corner. A surprise guest could show up, or you could throw yourself into WFHing. One minute, you’re trying to help; the next minute, you’re doing their bidding for them. Like a massive closet re-org or a paper-shredding marathon."
  },
  "1": {
    "prediction": "As the emo moon lines up with passionate Mars in your showy fifth house today, your inner wild child comes out to play. You can’t help but put your personality on display now. It’s bound to shine through, from the gleam in your eye to the dopamine-bright pieces you’re wearing. Otherwise, unwanted drama could flare up. The only kind of drama you want now is more along the lines of a smoky eye, a sweeping updo and a tantalizing tango. No button-pushing allowed!"
  },
  "2": {
    "prediction": "If you’ve been feeling a little lethargic, today’s moon-Mars summit in your salubrious sixth house will provide a welcome jolt of motivation. Layer up for a brisk lunchtime walk or stream a fun bootcamp workout you can do from the comfort of home. If you’re inundated at work, this cosmic combo can enable you to find the ideal assistant who can help out on a particular project or support you on a long-term basis."
  },
  "3": {
    "prediction": "Sleep in if you can get away with it this morning—or head to bed early tonight with a sexy companion. The sensitive moon tangoes with lusty Mars in your intimacy zone, ramping up your libido and blending it with strong emotions. If you’re unattached, you might wind up sexting with the latest protagonist in your fantasies (or maybe there’s more than one!) Mars will take this from zero to 60 in a hot second, but don’t play with fire or you might get burned."
  },
  "4": {
    "prediction": "Rather than forging ahead, come up with a game plan and identify any tasks you can delegate. Or spend today connecting with possible collaborators for your next project. A little schmoozing goes a long way, so stop short of flattery that may ring false."
  },
  "5": {
    "prediction": "Choose your crew carefully, since retrograde Mars could agitate the troops instead of rallying them. This is not the time for training a rookie or trying to reform a rebel. You need talented worker bees who are up to the task and have a winning attitude. Otherwise, you’ll spend half your time fixing their mistakes."
  },
  "6": {
    "prediction": "You’ve given this situation everything you’ve got, and the results are still the same. The only thing to do now is reach out to a sweet, smart friend who can offer you a shoulder to cry on and maybe a few words of wisdom. Let them take care of YOU for a change, Crab! Or release all those feels in a cardio sesh. You might even have a revelation on the Peloton."
  },
  "7": {
    "prediction": "Don’t hesitate to go after what you need when the responsive moon aligns with bold Mars in Gemini and your resourceful second house. You’re focused on finances and other bottom-line issues and shouldn’t hold back on a big ask like a budget increase for a project you’re heading up."
  },
  "8": {
    "prediction": "There’s no stopping you today when the moon meets up with can-do Mars in your sign. Don’t apologize for aiming high. You have as much right as anyone to go after what you want, so give it your best shot. But try not to come on like gangbusters. Put a plan out there, and family and friends will jump onboard in a heartbeat.  "
  },
  "9": {
    "prediction": "Take meetings and get together for coffee or cocktails—in person or on Zoom—while you’re feeling so outgoing and articulate. But remember Mars is in reverse, so you’ll need to soften the edge of any cutting comments. Hurt feelings are not the reaction you’re going for."
  },
  "10": {
    "prediction": "This is not the time for training a rookie or trying to reform a rebel. You need talented worker bees who are up to the task and have a winning attitude. Otherwise, you’ll spend half your time fixing their mistakes."
  },
  "11": {
    "prediction": "If you’re worried about an unexpected expense, brainstorm innovative ways to come up with the dough. Those vintage highball glasses you never use could command a premium on Etsy."
  },
  "12": {
    "prediction": "You don’t just want to stretch a bit beyond your usual boundaries today, Libra; you’re eager to break new ground! As the receptive moon aligns with go-getter Mars in your exploratory ninth house, you want to experience new people, places and things. Let your heady restlessness lead you to exciting adventures. "
